# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Added initial support for interpreting Kubernetes environment variables
    sourced from the Downward API. `metadata.annotations`, `metadata.labels`,
    and `status.podIPs` are not supported.
